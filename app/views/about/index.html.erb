  <strong>About Page</strong>
</p>

<p>
  WICI, a non-profit organization founded in 2015, serves as an inclusive social and professional network of graduate and postdoctoral students of all genders and experiences. Our mission is to support the health and wellness of our members and community, as well as to promote women in chemistry and chemical engineering, through events both on campus and in the Bay Area. We believe that providing these opportunities for socialization, discussion, and support will increase the visibility of women in STEM, make connections with our local community, and encourage women to pursue careers in STEM.

<p>
	Since it was founded in June 2015, WICI has attracted more than 250 members, and our social media outreach connects more than 4,000 individuals on Facebook. WICI holds a variety of events every month that have drawn consistently strong attendance. Our programming includes monthly game, trivia, and craft nights, meetups at local restaurants, social and networking hours, and keynote talks from prominent female faculty in chemistry.
